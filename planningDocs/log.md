## 2025-02-25 21:15:00 HST - Tailwind CSS Fix and Testing Results

We encountered an issue with Tailwind CSS when trying to build the project. The issue was related to the Tailwind CSS version and its PostCSS integration. We fixed it by:

1. Uninstalling the current Tailwind CSS setup:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
   ```

2. Installing a compatible version:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss@^3.4.0 postcss autoprefixer
   ```

3. Updating the PostCSS configuration:
   ```js
   // postcss.config.js
   export default {
     plugins: {
       tailwindcss: {},
       autoprefixer: {},
     },
   }
   ```

4. Reinitializing Tailwind CSS:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

After these changes, the build process completed successfully, and we were able to run both the development server (`npm run dev`) and preview the production build (`npm run preview`).

### Testing Results

We successfully tested:
- Navigation between pages using the bottom nav
- Schedule item expansion and filtering
- Map interactions with markers
- Vendor list filtering

The application works as expected and is ready for deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Next Steps for Deployment

1. Create a GitHub repository for the project if not already done
2. Push the code to the repository
3. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Verify the deployment by visiting the GitHub Pages URL

Once deployed, we'll proceed with Phase 2 to add PWA capabilities and offline support.

## 2025-02-25 21:12:20 HST - Navigation Updates and GitHub Preparation

We made the following changes to prepare for deployment:

1. Swapped the order of "Schedule" and "Vendors" in the bottom navigation bar
   - Modified the `BottomNav.jsx` component to change the order
   - Schedule is now the last item in the navigation

2. Updated GitHub configuration for user lpcode080
   - Changed the homepage URL in package.json to: `https://lpcode080.github.io/TechFamilyFunFair`
   - Updated the repository URL in README.md
   - The base path in vite.config.js was confirmed to be correct: `/TechFamilyFunFair/`

### GitHub Pages Deployment Steps

1. Create the TechFamilyFunFair repository on GitHub (if not already created)

2. Initialize Git in the project folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Add all files to Git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Make the initial commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit of Tech Family Fun Fair app"
   ```

5. Connect to the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/lpcode080/TechFamilyFunFair.git
   ```

6. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

7. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

The application will then be available at: https://lpcode080.github.io/TechFamilyFunFair/

## 2025-02-25 21:16:25 HST - Directory Structure and Deployment Script

We encountered an issue with running commands from the wrong directory. The project structure is:

```
/TechFamilyFunFair           <-- Root project directory
  ├── planningDocs/          <-- Planning documents
  │   ├── log.md
  │   └── plan.md
  └── tech-family-fun-fair/  <-- Actual React application
      ├── package.json
      ├── src/
      └── ...
```

The issue was trying to run npm commands from the root `/TechFamilyFunFair` directory instead of the `/TechFamilyFunFair/tech-family-fun-fair` directory where the package.json is located.

### Fixed Directory Navigation

To correctly navigate and run commands:

1. Always ensure you're in the React application directory:
   ```bash
   cd tech-family-fun-fair
   ```

2. Then run npm commands:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Automated Deployment Script

To simplify the deployment process and avoid directory errors, we created a deployment script at `tech-family-fun-fair/deploy-script.sh` that:

1. Ensures operations are performed in the correct directory
2. Initializes Git if needed
3. Adds and commits all files
4. Sets up the GitHub remote
5. Pushes to GitHub
6. Runs the deployment to GitHub Pages

To use the script:

```bash
cd TechFamilyFunFair    # Navigate to root project directory
./tech-family-fun-fair/deploy-script.sh
```

Or if you're already in the tech-family-fun-fair directory:

```bash
./deploy-script.sh
```

This script ensures all operations are performed in the correct context, eliminating directory-related errors during deployment.

## 2025-02-27 15:45:23 HST - Application Optimization

## Git Repository Management Lessons Learned (March 4)

During our repository setup, we encountered several challenges that provided valuable lessons for future projects:

### Issues Encountered
- Large files in the repository causing push failures (HTTP 400 errors)
- Nested Git repository creating conflicts with the parent repository
- Unintentional tracking of large data files and build artifacts
- Repository size exceeding GitHub's recommended push limits

### Diagnostic Strategies
- Using `git status` to identify uncommitted changes and untracked files
- Running `find . -type f -size +1M` to locate large files in the repository
- Checking `git remote -v` to verify remote repository configuration
- Using `git ls-files | grep pattern` to identify specific files being tracked
- Examining `git count-objects -v` to assess repository size and object count

### Prevention Strategies for Future Projects
- Create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file at the beginning of the project
- Add common exclusions for build artifacts, dependencies, and large data files:
  - `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, etc.
  - Data directories containing large files (`data/`, `assets/raw/`, etc.)
  - IDE-specific files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`, etc.)
- Avoid creating nested Git repositories within a project
- Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for managing large binary files when necessary
- Regularly audit repository size with `git count-objects -v`
- Consider using shallow clones for large repositories with extensive history

### Repository Cleanup Techniques
- Creating a clean repository with only essential files
- Using `git rm --cached` to remove tracked files without deleting them
- Implementing `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner for removing large files from history
- Utilizing `git gc` to clean up and optimize the repository

These lessons will help us maintain cleaner, more efficient repositories in future projects, avoiding common pitfalls that can lead to deployment issues and repository bloat.

## 2025-03-05 15:30:00 HST - Fixed JSON Data Loading for Deployment

### Issue
After deploying to GitHub Pages, we discovered that the JSON data files (experiences.json, vendors.json, schedule.json, map.json) were not being properly included in the build, causing empty pages in the deployed application.

### Solution
1. Created a public/assets/data directory to store JSON files for static serving
2. Copied all JSON data files from src/assets/data to public/assets/data
3. Updated all components to fetch JSON data from the public directory:
   - Modified Experiences.jsx to fetch experiences.json via fetch API
   - Modified ExperienceDetail.jsx to fetch experiences.json via fetch API
   - Modified Home.jsx to fetch vendors.json via fetch API
   - Modified Vendors.jsx to fetch vendors.json via fetch API
   - Modified Map.jsx to fetch map.json and schedule.json via fetch API
   - Modified Schedule.jsx to fetch schedule.json via fetch API

### Technical Details
- Replaced direct imports like `import data from '../assets/data/file.json'` with dynamic fetching
- Added state variables and useEffect hooks to handle asynchronous data loading
- Implemented error handling for fetch operations
- Updated dependency arrays in useMemo hooks to react to data changes

### Benefits
